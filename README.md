# Todo App

This is a simple Todo application built using React, TypeScript, Redux, and React Router to demonstrate basic CRUD operations and routing in a React application.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds types to the language to improve code quality and understandability.
- **Redux Toolkit**: A toolset for efficient Redux development that provides good defaults and encapsulates best practices.
- **React Router**: A standard library for routing in React.
- **SCSS**: Used for styling the application, allowing more advanced features than regular CSS.
